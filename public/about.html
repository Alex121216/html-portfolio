<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Alexeys Blanco Diaz, though I prefer to go by Alex. Born in Cuba in 1982, I am 41 years old and 
  fluent in four languages, with Spanish as my mother tongue. My journey began with a passion for education, 
  culminating in my graduation as an English teacher in Cuba in 2008. However, my unwavering stance against 
  the repressive Cuban regime led to my dismissal in 2010, a consequence of the government's tight grip on 
  job positions, particularly within the education sector, which silenced dissenting voices.
  <p>

<p>Beyond my dedication to education and technology, I immersed myself in political activism and journalism, 
  starting in 2003. Fearlessly advocating for political independence and human rights, I wielded my voice as 
  a journalist to expose the injustices perpetrated by the Cuban regime. Despite the daunting risks and 
  pressures, I remained resolute in my mission to champion freedom of expression and challenge tyranny. 
  Yet, my advocacy came at a price; I faced censorship, harassment, and threats from government authorities. 
  Nevertheless, I persisted, unwavering in my belief in the transformative power of information to instigate 
  positive change and sow the seeds of hope for a brighter tomorrow.
</p>

<p>These experiences as a political activist and journalist have indelibly shaped my perspective, fueling my 
  unwavering determination to continue advocating for justice and freedom. As I embark on new opportunities, 
  I carry with me the conviction to use my voice and expertise to foster a world where liberty and human rights 
  flourish unabated.
</p>

<p>In 2016, I acquired my first laptop and embarked on self-study in cybersecurity and programming. 
  Despite limited opportunities and resources in my homeland, my determination remained steadfast. 
  In 2022, with the help of my beloved and amazing cousin Mailyn Blanco Lemas, I had the life-changing 
  opportunity to relocate to the United States, where I saw the chance to pursue my aspirations in technology. 
  Investing in a quality laptop, I set out to realize my dream of becoming a programmer or cybersecurity expert. 
  Through diligent research, I found web development to align closely with my interests and goals, offering 
  the flexibility to work remotelyâ€”a dream come true for me. Thanks to the comprehensive web development 
  course on Udemy, led by the insightful Angela, I am now on the path to fulfilling my long-held aspirations 
  in the technology field.
</p>

<p>In conclusion, my journey from Cuba to the United States has been marked by challenges and determination. 
  Despite facing adversity and limited resources in my homeland, my passion for technology and commitment to 
  self-improvement have propelled me forward. Now, with the guidance of online courses and the support of a 
  new community and my family, I am steadily turning my dreams into reality, one line of code at a time.
